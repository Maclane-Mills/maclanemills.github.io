    <p1> The three websites that I chose to review in this assignment include Sheplers, Delta Airlines and Sting Saddlery. I really liked Sheplers Western Wear's website when it came to navigation ablility and browsing for different products. All of the product links worked well and directed me to the portion of the website I was looking for. Delta like Sheplers did a good job with its navigational structure. Every navigation link worked and made navigation around the website easy. Sting Saddlery's website had navigation links that worked but did not have a search bar to look for specific products. Sting Saddlery also did not have prices for all of its products only providing a phone number to call for pricing.</p1>

        Coloring for each website also played a role in how modern and fresh each website appeared. Delta no suprise used its logo colors effectivily in highlighting its website. Delta did a good job and accented its website with its logo colors without making it look overdone. Sheplers unlike Delta didnt include its red and white logo colors within its website. Sheplers instead used cooler tones of grey and black. Overall Sheplers and Delta airlines did a good job highlighting their website with different color combinations. Sting Saddlery in this section of review did ok with color to elevate its website. Sting used a simple three tone color combination that was simple and elegant in presenting their products.

        The layout for the three websites I reviewed were all different in thier own individual way. Delta Airlines used a three coloum layout that was skillfully reorganized into a two column design as you scrolled down the website. The search bar on Delta's website is not in its traditional place at the top of the website but instead at the bottom giving it a fresh and different look. Sheplers Western Wear also uses a three column style when looking at products. It also unlike Delta does not have a floating header when scrolling. However the header that Sheplers uses is so large it is acceptable that it does not have a scrolling affect. Sting Saddlery in this section did a good job with their layout. Sting uses a simple one column form of organization that works well for its product presentation. Sting also has a simple scrolling affect that was well designed. </p1>

        Each website had a couple of little things that seperated them from each other. Delta did a great job with its color application and its navigation bar. Delta only applied its logo colors in tasteful manner. And Delta's navigation bar had flight information incorporated getting directly to the point with little thought about navigating. Sheplers Western Wear also applied its colors in a tasteful fashion. Using dark earth tones sheplers highlighted its website effectivley. One point Sheplers also used to great affect in its webstie was the drop down menu when hovering over its products. It made it quick and easy to find exact products. Sting Saddlery did a good job with color and layout but fell flat when it came to navigation and content information. </p1>

    <p1> overall the three websites I reviewed had intresting differences that made them stand out from each other. It was easy to identify the proffesionally build websites like Delta and Sheplers over a small saddle shop in Lewistown. I do believe that Sting Saddlery did a good job with how it layed out its website and its color combination and needs little advancements in navigation and content to make it really standout from other websites. I would describe Delta and Sheplers as good and Sting Saddlery as slightly worse but not terrible. </p1>
